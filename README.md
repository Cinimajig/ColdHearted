# Cold hearted
## VS Code theme based on my PowerShell ISE theme

*If you want to change the color of the comments back gray, you can add this bit to your* `settings.json`.

```json
"editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
        "[Cold hearted]": {
            "comments": "#7f848e",
        }
    }
```

**Enjoy!**
